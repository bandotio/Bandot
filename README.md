Bandot has innovatively designed a cross-chain DeFi combinable platform to maximize the liquidity of users' assets, providing unprecedented convenience in unsecured lending, stable coin exchange, and liquid mining.

In the process of asset cross-chain circulation, the connection between users, data, and usage scenarios is completed. Allow users to freely realize cross-chain asset transfer between different applications, and finally form an ecosystem with free circulation of value.

## Cross-chain unsecured lending

Unsecured lending is a new DeFi attempt that uses a credit guarantee mechanism to allow users to borrow without collateralizing actual assets.

Bandot tried cross-chain credit mortgage in Polkadot, that is, the credit accumulated on other parallel chains of Polkadot can also be seamlessly used as a mortgage certificate on Bandot, so that users can obtain high returns through a combination of multiple types of assets.

The Guru is an asset cross-chain bridge gateway launched by the Bandot team. It serves as a bridge connecting the multi-currency asset market and the Polkadot DeFi market, allowing users with different assets to participate in the upcoming Polkadot DeFi market more conveniently and seamlessly . Since Guru was officially launched on December 21, the development has progressed smoothly, and the mortgage platform on the PC and mobile phones has been opened.
